# MLOps Example
Demonstrate operationalising MLOps 

## Background
Using this [Tensorflow tutorial](https://developers.redhat.com/learn/openshift-data-science/how-create-tensorflow-model) tutorial and this [workflow](https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/cl-mlops-architecture-openshift-infographic-f31021-202202-en.pdf)

1. Model Training
In the Tensorflow tutorial we learn how create and train a model in a Jupyter notebook. Here we transition this job into IBM Code Engine as a batch job. 

The inputs are the MNIST image data set for training and the test data set. The output is a model output file in object storage.
